## Project Description
This project's goal was to create an application that helps companies generate emails for their employees. It takes in the user's first name, last name, and department. It returns a random password. It also allows you to change the password and define an alternate email.

## Languages
Java

## How to Run
Open in your IDE. Create a new object and insert the first and last name.

## How to Use
This would be used by companies needing to generate company emails and passwords for their new hires.

## Future Plans
I would like to develope this into a larger scale project. This means something that looks more like a website (isn't being run in the terminal). It would generate the email, send the information to the employee, and keep a confidental copy.
There is a lot of room to get creative with the project! I've just laid out the ground work.

## Project Description
This project's goal was to create an application that helps schools enroll new students. It takes in the student's first name, last name, and year. It returns a 5 digit ID which starts with the student's year. It also allows the enrollment of certain courses and adds cost of each course to the tuition. You can also check and pay tuition.

## Languages
Java

## How to Run
Open in your IDE. Run. It will ask how many students you'd like to add. From there you will be prompted to answer information for each student.

## How to Use
This would be used by schools who need to enroll students and keep track of tuition.

## Future Plans
This is only the beginning for this project. In the future I'd like to add more features such as different costs per class, more options, and a beautiful user interface.
