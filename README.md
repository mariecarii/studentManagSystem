## Project Description
This project's goal was to create an application that helps schools enroll new students. It takes in the student's first name, last name, and year. It returns a 5 digit ID which starts with the student's year. It also allows the enrollment of certain courses and adds cost of each course to the tuition. You can also check and pay tuition.

## Languages
Java

## How to Run
Open in your IDE. Run. It will ask how many students you'd like to add. From there you will be prompted to answer information for each student.

## How to Use
This would be used by schools who need to enroll students and keep track of tuition.

## Future Plans
This is only the beginning for this project. In the future I'd like to add more features such as different costs per class, more options, and a beautiful user interface.
